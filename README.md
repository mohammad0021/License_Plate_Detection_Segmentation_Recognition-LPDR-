# License_Plate_Detection_Segmentation_Recognition (LPDR)
License Plate Recognition is an image-processing technology used to identify vehicles by their license plates. This technology is used in various security and traffic applications.

License Plate Recognition is an important task with many applications in Intelligent Transportation and Surveillance systems. 
Where it could be used as a core in various applications, such as security, traffic control, and electronic payment systems (e.g. freeway toll payment and parking fee payment).This work presents an end-to-end ALPR method based on a hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The core idea of the proposed method is to identify the vehicle and the license plate region using two passes on the same CNN, and then to recognize the characters using a second CNN.
